839,"Let's discuss spam, spammers, and the spamming spammers who spam. What did the moderator say to the subscribers?

Nobody knows, because nobody ever reads what moderators write.

------

Yes, it was a bad joke, but at least it wasn't a repost... which is *kind of* what we're here to discuss today:

As many of you are no doubt aware, spammers and bad actors have been flooding Reddit lately, and /r/Jokes has started to get hit pretty hard. Dealing with the issue isn't as easy as it sounds, though, because any action that we take has the potential to affect good-faith users. Still, we've been discussing the problem, and we've come up with the beginnings of a solution: 

We're going to ban every last one of our subscribers.

Just kidding! In fact, we're going to give you a bit more insight into how spammers work, what their goals are, and why they're so effective on Reddit. This information will be included on [our complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index), which we've also streamlined and updated. (The rules themselves haven't changed; we've just made them a bit clearer and more condensed.) Our hope is that you'll be able to recognize and report spammers when you see them, which will help us keep them from gaining more of a foothold here.

We'll be taking some other anti-spam actions behind the scenes, so rest assured, we aren't trying to dump the spam-fighting on you. We just figured that it was better to keep everyone informed... because after all, /r/Jokes is a community, and a community is only as smart as its dumbest member.

(Yes, the moderators count as members, and yes, we're easily the dumbest.)

Thank you for reading, and remember to report spam when you see it!",jokes,283

Since he was a chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets. When he looked at the sky, he couldn’t tell what the winter was going to be like.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

But, being a practical leader, after several days, he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the Canadian Weather Service and asked, ‘Is the coming winter going to be cold?’

‘It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,’ the meteorologist at the weather service responded.
So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the Canadian Weather Service again. ‘Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?’

‘Yes,’ the man at Weather Service again replied, ‘it’s going to be a very cold winter.’

The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

Two weeks later, the chief called the Canadian Weather Service again. ‘Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?’

‘Absolutely,’ the man replied.  ‘It’s looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we’ve ever seen.’

‘How can you be so sure?’ the chief asked.

The weatherman replied, ‘The Indians are collecting an astounding amount of firewood !’",jokes,289

Most stores in the area were closed, as it was a holiday, and the lab was in a rather remote location. “Find me a suitable placebo in 20 minutes or you’re FIRED!”

It was a long shot, but the assistant was running out of time, and decided to try it. Sure enough, the store sold fake mints, which looked just like Altoids, but we’re infused with all sorts of disgusting and repulsive flavors - vomit, garbage juice, wet dog - real nasty stuff. The lab assistant thought, “Well, no one is really supposed to taste the pills anyway, we can simply tell the participants that the drug is extremely bitter, so they should swallow quickly with water to avoid tasting it.” The assistant bought up the entire store’s supply. 

The plan worked like a charm; none of the participants had any clue which pill was the drug and which was the placebo. But shockingly, the placebo consistently produced a more calming effect than the drug they were actually testing!

So he sent messengers throughout all the lands on the globe encouraging the nations to send their best warriors to come to his palace and compete for this prestigious title. After weeks of intense competition, the candidate pool was reduced to the last three competitors.  Each had earned the honor of demonstrating their martial prowess in front of the emperor himself, and he alone would make the final selection. 

The first of the three warriors to step up to the throne was a Shaolin monk. After silently bowing to the emperor, the monk proceeded to take out a small matchbox and opened it. A single fly buzzed out. In the blink of an eye, the Shaolin monk unsheathed his sword and made a single swipe at the fly. It fell to the floor in two pieces. The emperor was impressed. 

The second warrior who approached the throne was a samurai decked in his silk armor. Without wasting any time, he also produced a matchbox of his own, and after opening it, another fly buzzed out. Between the space of a pair of heartbeats, his sword flashed twice. The fly fell to the floor in FOUR pieces. The emperor was VERY impressed.

The last warrior to step into the room... was a little underwhelming. He wore no armor, just plain white robes that were a little dusty from the road. He had thick glasses on and wore a yamaka on his head. ""Shalom, your majesty! It is an honor to be here today,"" he said, and proceeded to pull out his own matchbox. As the fly buzzed out, any doubt that the emperor had in this Jewish warrior vanished as his sword blurred in the air to the point it was almost invisible. In the span of 5 seconds, his sword must have swung over 100 times at the fly! In a smooth motion, the warrior sheathed his sword and nodded in satisfaction. 

The fly continued buzzing around him.

As class started, I decided this would be a good opportunity to teach the students a lesson on why drinking alcohol excessively would be a bad idea. So I first recited, *Suramerayamajja pamadatthana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami* (I undertake the precept to abstain from over intoxication and abuse of drugs or alcohol).

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercings, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to care for myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

They walk further along the park. The sun is shining bright and there's a nice fragrance in the air. Then Satan points to a parking garage and says ""click the button on your key ring."" The atheist clicks it and notices a particular car flashing its lights. He says, ""is that a silver Tesla?"" Satan replied ""I heard its your dream car, right? I just think that everyone deserves a reliable way of transportation. I don't want anyone panting to get around in hell. That Tesla is all yours."" The atheist thanked him.

So this man decides to buy a bidet for his toilet. He gets it installed, and over time (with a couple surprises) he gets pretty comfortable using the controls. It's got a self cleaning function that flushes the nozzle, and he uses it before getting up and going on with things.

One night, he wanders in to pee, wearing only his shorts, and remembers he didn't flush it because the phone rang, and reaches down to the dial, flipping it quick left, then back to center... and a bit more.

The bidet shoots out and sprays, hitting him *precisely* in the belly button, filling it and spraying back onto the seat, running down his legs, and the floor in the second before he realizes what is happening and wrenches it off with a shout.

""What happened?"" asks his companion.

A nun, really needing to go to the bathroom, walked into a local Hooters.  

The place was hopping with music and dancing, but every once in a while, the lights would turn off.  

Each time after the lights would go out, the place would erupt into cheers.

However, when the revelers saw the nun, the room went dead silent.  

She walked up to the bartender and asked,  “May I please use the restroom?” 

The bartender replied, “I really don't think you should.” 

“Why not?” the nun asked. 

“Well, there is a statue of a naked man in there, and his most private parts are covered only by a fig leaf.” 

“Nonsense,” said the nun,  “I'll just look the other way.” 

So, the bartender showed the nun the door at the top of the stairs, and she preceded to use the restroom.  

After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again.  

However, they did stop just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause.

She went to the bartender and said,  “Sir, I don't understand.  Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?” 

“Well, now they know you're one of us.” said the bartender.  “Would you like a drink?”

Well, as it turns out, they are avid gardeners in their spare time. Even more so, they love growing flowers. They grow all kinds of flowers. Roses, Orchids, Daisies, you name it, they grow them.

Well, one year, a monastery is strapped for cash. They decide to have a village-wide festival and sell their flowers to the public for the cash they need.

The first festival didn't go so well, but resolved to try again next the year.

Luckily, the next year, a well known movie star (known for playing a movie character that has sharp, retractable metal claws) happened to be in the village.

With such a celebrity hosting the festival, things should go really well. So they ask the celebrity if he would host their festival and make himself seen amongst the flowers and talk to the public about flower related things.

The actor is in a good mood and agrees.

The festival was a raging success! The monastery was now flush with cash. It was so successful that the organizers of the festival asked the celebrity if he would come back and do it again next year.

The actor agreed.

Not only that, but the actor came back five years in a row!

But then, one year, due to scheduling conflicts, the actor couldn't make it to the festival, so they tried to get some other people to host the event.. As a result, the public was severely disappointed and didn't buy very many flowers and the festival was a complete and total dud. 

The same thing happened the next year as well; the actor couldn't make it to the festival and it was a total failure. No matter who they got to host the festival, it wasn't successful.

The organizers were losing tons of money when the actor didn't show up.

1516,"TV dealership... A blonde walks into a store and after a bit of perusing, she points to the wall and tells the cashier that she'd like to buy a TV. The cashier responds, *""Well I'm sorry ma'am, but we don't sell to blondes. We even have a sign...""* as he points to a giant **""NO BLONDES ALLOWED""** sign on his left. *""I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.""*

The reluctant blonde scoffs and storms off furiously. Later that night she can't stop thinking about what happened and tells herself that one way or another she's going to buy that TV. The next day she wakes up real early, throws on a red wig and sunglasses, and heads back to the store.

*""Goodmorning sir, I'd like to purchase that beautiful TV""* she says pointing to the wall. Without even looking up from his news paper the cashier responds, *""Now ma'am, I already told ye, we don't sell to blondes. I'm sorry but you need to leave.""* Stunned and speechless, the blonde storms out. Once back home, she wonders *""How did he know?""* so the next day she throws on a black wig, a funny looking hat, and a monocle before heading back to the store.

*""ELLO MATE! I'D LIKE TO BUY THAT TV THERE, YEAH?""* she tells the cashier. He puts down his coffee and responds, *""Miss, I already told ye, NO BLONDES ALLOWED... Please, be on your way and don't make this any more difficult!""*

She can't believe it. Once she gets home she spends all night working on a new disguise and the next day she heads for the shop wearing a brunette wig, a hoodie, and a fake mustache.

*""Hellooo, I'd like to buy one-""*

*""I ALREADY TOLD YE,* **NO BLONDES ALLOWED!!!""** the cashier rudely interrupts. Absolutely furious at this point she tears off the wig, slams it on the ground, and yells, *""HOW DO YOU ALWAYS KNOW I'M A BLONDE!?""* to which he replies with a sigh, ""Because ma'am...""

Stranger: If I can tell you exactly how many sheep you have without counting them, will you let me have one of them as a prize?

The farmer, out of curiosity , agreed.

So the stranger booted up a laptop, calibrated his measurement tool, connected to a satellite positioning system, took various sort of atmospheric measurements and used a very sophisticated algorithm to calculate the number of sheep. He then proceeded to tell the farmer exactly how many sheep were in the farmer's flock. The farmer, true to his word, told the stranger to take one of the sheep. As the stranger picked up one of the sheep and was on his way to leave, the farmer called out to him and asked: ""You wouldn't happen to be a consultant now, would you?""

The stranger, a bit surprised, replied that he was indeed a consultant and asked the farmer how he figured it out.

To which the farmer replied:

""Well for one thing, I never asked you how many sheep I have, you brought it up yourself. Secondly, You gave me information which I already had and it provided me with no benefit whatsoever. Lastly, that sheep you picked up and are now carrying away isn't a sheep, it's my dog""",jokes,236

But tragically, the man loses his balance and falls from the bell tower, dying immediately.

As the police arrive to investigate, they ask the minister ""Who is this man?""

The minister says ""I didn't get his name, but his face rings a bell.""

The next week, the minister is in his office when someone knocks on his door.  ""Father,"" he says, ""The man who died here last week was my brother.""

""Oh, it was such a tragedy.  Are you okay my son?""

""Yes, Father, I am still in grief over my loss, but I've decided to honor my brother. I would like to apply for the bell ringer job.  As you can see I have both of my arms so I don't need to use my face as my brother did.""

The minister thinks for a second.  ""Yes, of course, perhaps you could ring the bells now to show us how you do.""
