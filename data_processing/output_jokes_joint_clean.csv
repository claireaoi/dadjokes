592,"A family sat down to dinner... They had prepared quite the spread with steak, corn, salad, and everyone had their own favorite side. The father had prepared his own signature spice blend and was encouraging everyone to try it. The son tried a little bit on his mac and cheese. Unfortunately he began coughing as it was too spicy, but was able to rinse it down with a bit of water and was fine. The daughter didn't believe it could be as spicy as her brother claimed, so she put some of the spice blend on her mashed potatoes. She took a big bite and after a bit her face turned red and she began coughing and spluttering and went and got herself a glass of milk in order to help with the spiciness.  The mother laughed, knowing that the blend was spicy, but decided to try some anyway on her fries. She was conservative with her application, and could handle her spice better than her children so she thought she would be fine. And, if it weren't for a small bit of fry trying to go down the wrong pipe, causing her to cough, splutter and wheeze, she would have made it out unscathed.Finally the father, after having witnessed that none of his family were able to master his own homemade spice blend, added it to every bit of his meal. The steak, the corn, his green beans and even his salad. He the requested some of each of the others' sides, and added the spices to some mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and fries as well. Then, to show he was not joking around, he added some hot sauce to top it all off. He began happily chowing down on every bit of it, completely unconcerned with the level of spice. He did not turn red, he did not cough, he did not splutter, he did not wheeze.However, in his gusto to complete the meal, he was eating faster than he normal would and a half-chewed piece of steak unfortunately made it down the wrong pipe. His eyes went wide. Still, he did not cough, he did not splutter, he did not wheeze. But, he did begin to turn red. And then, he began to turn blue. Seeing that her husband was choking, the mother got up from the table and started trying to give the heimlich to the father. It didn't seem to be working until suddenly -- 	p-tooo, out came the piece of steak. Then the father coughed, spluttered and wheezed. As he tried to regain his breath, his family heard that he was trying to say something between coughing fits. A 'thank you' to his wife, most likely. Or perhaps he was trying to say he should have slowed down and not eaten so fast to show them up. When he finally got himself under control, this is what he said.""Well family, it seems that while choking is bad for us all, Dad Chokes are the worst.""",dadjokes,503

1479,"A family sat down to dinner... They had prepared quite the spread with steak, corn, salad, and everyone had their own favorite side. The father had prepared his own signature spice blend and was encouraging everyone to try it. The son tried a little bit on his mac and cheese. Unfortunately he began coughing as it was too spicy, but was able to rinse it down with a bit of water and was fine. The daughter didn't believe it could be as spicy as her brother claimed, so she put some of the spice blend on her mashed potatoes. She took a big bite and after a bit her face turned red and she began coughing and spluttering and went and got herself a glass of milk in order to help with the spiciness.  The mother laughed, knowing that the blend was spicy, but decided to try some anyway on her fries. She was conservative with her application, and could handle her spice better than her children so she thought she would be fine. And, if it weren't for a small bit of fry trying to go down the wrong pipe, causing her to cough, splutter and wheeze, she would have made it out unscathed.Finally the father, after having witnessed that none of his family were able to master his own homemade spice blend, added it to every bit of his meal. The steak, the corn, his green beans and even his salad. He the requested some of each of the others' sides, and added the spices to some mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and fries as well. Then, to show he was not joking around, he added some hot sauce to top it all off. He began happily chowing down on every bit of it, completely unconcerned with the level of spice. He did not turn red, he did not cough, he did not splutter, he did not wheeze.However, in his gusto to complete the meal, he was eating faster than he normal would and a half-chewed piece of steak unfortunately made it down the wrong pipe. His eyes went wide. Still, he did not cough, he did not splutter, he did not wheeze. But, he did begin to turn red. And then, he began to turn blue. Seeing that her husband was choking, the mother got up from the table and started trying to give the heimlich to the father. It didn't seem to be working until suddenly -- 	p-tooo, out came the piece of steak. Then the father coughed, spluttered and wheezed. As he tried to regain his breath, his family heard that he was trying to say something between coughing fits. A 'thank you' to his wife, most likely. Or perhaps he was trying to say he should have slowed down and not eaten so fast to show them up. When he finally got himself under control, this is what he said.""Well family, it seems that while choking is bad for us all, Dad Chokes are the worst.""",dadjokes,503

He finds a couple of okay options: some country, some rap, some metal Nothing really sticks out as the next big thing to him though. He keeps at it for an entire weekend, struggling to find something he really likes.He then stumbles upon this video of an old man, playing the acoustic guitar on his front porch: a beautiful rendition of Stairway to Heaven. Gentle, touching, absolutely gorgeous. The bar owner cant help but cry. He immediately knows this is the man he wants for his bar, and gets in contact with him.The musician, over the phone, thank him over and over again for the amazing opportunity. He explains that hes a retired judge who was pressured to go into law by his parents, over 50 years ago. In his heart, hes always dreamed of being a musician and to perform in front of a real audience. This is the first time hell ever get to do it.The bar owner is even more touched by his story, and decides to immediately sign him on for 10 night shows.

He tells them to bring some friends, bring some family, no one has ever heard music like that before. The patrons are excited and promise to bring everyone they know.The night arrives, and the old judge gets on stage. The bar is absolutely packed, people give him a standing ovation before hes even started. Beaming with joy and trying his best not to cry, he calms the audience down.

I hope you like them. He sits down and starts playing.He slams down on his guitar and lets out a piercing screech. Everyone in the room freezes For the next half hour, without ever stopping, he plays dozens of discordant chords while yelling incoherent words like pineapple sauce! and love and hate are second cousins!. He screams then whispers, playing notes that dont make any sort of reasonable sense.The audience is stunned. No one dares to say a word. The sweet old man seems so sincere in his rendition, yet its just horrendous.The owner has a million thoughts racing all at once. How could this happen? Can he even get the courage to tell him that everything hes doing is absolutely terrible? One of the regulars comes up to the bar and sits down to talk to him.

Mum always loved to wear sarongs (fabric wraps that go around the torso and drape downward a bit like a long skirt would), so my uncle suggested that she wear a sarong in there.The funeral director looked a bit confused, as did some of our family members, to which my uncle added:""What's *sarong* with that?""I started laughing like an idiot. He was proud of it too. The funeral director was rather shocked. We assured her, and our more proper relatives, that Mum would've absolutely loved the joke (which is very true).His delivery was perfect. I'll never forget the risk he took.

Again, he stands trial, and again, he is sentenced to death, showing no remorse, only delight that he got to operate the train.  His last meal request is a single banana.  When he goes to the chair, the executioner pulls the switch, but nothing happens.  He goes free again.  The train-obsessed maniac, once more on the loose, wastes no time in hijacking a train and crashing it.  His trial is speedy, because this has already happened twice, and he is sentenced to death.

She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The father again looked at the dog and yelled, ""Dammit, Ginger!"" Once again the woman smiled and thought, ""Yes!"" A few minutes later the woman had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing. Again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, ""Dammit, Ginger, get away from her before she shits on you!""Edit - thanks for the awards!

This was his lifelong dream. If it's ok with you, I'd like to try just once for him.""The monk certainly couldn't refuse and slowly led the man up the long stairwell. Once at the top the man walked over to the bell.

The bell rang with the loudest clang the countryside had heard in years. In fact, it was so loud the man cried out in agonizing pain, lost his balance and fell to his death below.Once again the police showed up, and once again asked the monk if he knew the man's name to which the monk replied, ""no, but he's a dead ringer for his brother.""I'll show myself out.Good night",dadjokes,344

So, he's on death row and the executioner approaches him.""What would you like for your last meal?""""I would like a banana please.""The executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens!

Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""""Two bananas please.""The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.""Let me guess. Three bananas?""""Actually yes! How did you know?""""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.""I dont get it,"" says the executioner.

Dealing with the issue isn't as easy as it sounds, though, because any action that we take has the potential to affect good-faith users. Still, we've been discussing the problem, and we've come up with the beginnings of a solution: We're going to ban every last one of our subscribers.Just kidding! In fact, we're going to give you a bit more insight into how spammers work, what their goals are, and why they're so effective on Reddit. This information will be included on [our complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index), which we've also streamlined and updated. (The rules themselves haven't changed; we've just made them a bit clearer and more condensed.) Our hope is that you'll be able to recognize and report spammers when you see them, which will help us keep them from gaining more of a foothold here.We'll be taking some other anti-spam actions behind the scenes, so rest assured, we aren't trying to dump the spam-fighting on you. We just figured that it was better to keep everyone informed... because after all, /r/Jokes is a community, and a community is only as smart as its dumbest member.(Yes, the moderators count as members, and yes, we're easily the dumbest.)Thank you for reading, and remember to report spam when you see it!",jokes,283

I had to flesh out some details, but the gist of it is more or less what I remember. Of course, I have heard similar jokes, but this is my brain's spontaneous version.A guy got a job with a Chilean start up, and worked nonstop for a year, sacrificing weekends, holidays and time with loved ones, to ensure the business got off the ground. When things finally seemed to be going well, he told his boss he needed 14 days off, for a special trip he had been thinking about. This was a visit to his family's ancestral home deep in the Andes, which nobody in the family had visited for a couple of generations, as it was so remote, only accessible by dirt bike, pack mule, or hiking. It would be 7 days in, and 7 days out, by dirt bike.The boss said ""fine, but take a satellite phone, in case I need to call you"".So, he is 6 days into the trip, just 1 day short of the family village, and immensely enjoying the scenery, chatting with the locals, and sleeping under the stars, when the boss calls and says ""look, we're having a crisis, and I need you back soon as possible. How long will it take?""He says ""I don't know boss, it depends on weather, trail conditions and other factors"". The boss says ""well, do your best"". So he gets back on his bike, and even though it took him 6 days to get as far as he did, it only takes him 3 days to get back.Twenty years go by, and the guy is now a wealthy executive and the company is now huge, but even though he has travelled all around the world on business, he usually only takes a few days of holidays tacked onto a business trip, or if he plans more time off, it is usually interrupted by company needs. He decides he will try again to visit the family's ancestral village, while he is still young and healthy enough to make it. Things have not changed there, and it is still 7 days in, and 7 days out by dirt bike.So again, he is 6 days into the trip, just 1 day short of the family village, and immensely enjoying the scenery, chatting with the locals and sleeping under the stars, when the boss calls him on the satellite phone, and says ""look, we're having a crisis, and I need you back soon as possible. How long will it take?""He says ""I don't know, boss, it depends on weather, trail conditions and other factors"". The boss says ""well, do your best"". So he gets back on his bike, and even though it took him 6 days to get as far as he did, this time it only takes him 3 months to get back.",jokes,503

Most stores in the area were closed, as it was a holiday, and the lab was in a rather remote location. Find me a suitable placebo in 20 minutes or youre FIRED! The lab assistant immediately started searching online. Turns out, the only store that was open and nearby was a novelty shop, that sold all sorts of prank gadgets - hand buzzers, finger traps, that sort of thing. It was a long shot, but the assistant was running out of time, and decided to try it. Sure enough, the store sold fake mints, which looked just like Altoids, but were infused with all sorts of disgusting and repulsive flavors - vomit, garbage juice, wet dog - real nasty stuff. The lab assistant thought, Well, no one is really supposed to taste the pills anyway, we can simply tell the participants that the drug is extremely bitter, so they should swallow quickly with water to avoid tasting it. The assistant bought up the entire stores supply. The plan worked like a charm; none of the participants had any clue which pill was the drug and which was the placebo. But shockingly, the placebo consistently produced a more calming effect than the drug they were actually testing! The lead researcher was confounded, as every subsequent test with these novelty mints yielded the same result. Turns out, the real calm is always in the joke mints.",jokes,292

2930,"The emperor of Persia wanted the best bodyguard in the world. So he sent messengers throughout all the lands on the globe encouraging the nations to send their best warriors to come to his palace and compete for this prestigious title. After weeks of intense competition, the candidate pool was reduced to the last three competitors.  Each had earned the honor of demonstrating their martial prowess in front of the emperor himself, and he alone would make the final selection. The first of the three warriors to step up to the throne was a Shaolin monk. After silently bowing to the emperor, the monk proceeded to take out a small matchbox and opened it. A single fly buzzed out. In the blink of an eye, the Shaolin monk unsheathed his sword and made a single swipe at the fly. It fell to the floor in two pieces. The emperor was impressed. The second warrior who approached the throne was a samurai decked in his silk armor. Without wasting any time, he also produced a matchbox of his own, and after opening it, another fly buzzed out. Between the space of a pair of heartbeats, his sword flashed twice. The fly fell to the floor in FOUR pieces. The emperor was VERY impressed.The last warrior to step into the room... was a little underwhelming. He wore no armor, just plain white robes that were a little dusty from the road. He had thick glasses on and wore a yamaka on his head. ""Shalom, your majesty! It is an honor to be here today,"" he said, and proceeded to pull out his own matchbox. As the fly buzzed out, any doubt that the emperor had in this Jewish warrior vanished as his sword blurred in the air to the point it was almost invisible. In the span of 5 seconds, his sword must have swung over 100 times at the fly! In a smooth motion, the warrior sheathed his sword and nodded in satisfaction. The fly continued buzzing around him. After a moment of confused silence, the emperor asked awkwardly, ""...Excuse me, but, uh... why isn't the fly dead?""The warrior tilted his head slightly, and replied, ""Circumcision was never meant to kill, your majesty.""",jokes,373

Apologizing, the maiden offered Rick to pay for the repairs and a place to stay while they fixed his bike. My name is Yu! Its an honor to meet you! the beautiful maiden introduced herself to Rick. It turned out she was the daughter of a rich magistrate, so he spent the night in a small palace in the center of town. However, due to the scarcity of motorcycle parts, Rick had to spend several days in the palace, in the presence of Yu. Over the next few days, she took a liking to him and his strange American ways. As expected, Rick took a liking to her, too.The two quickly became inseparable, but Yus father did not approve, for Rick was an outsider.

Yu begged her father to let him stay, but instead, the Magistrate had Rick banished from the town. He warned him if he ever came back, he would have him beheaded.Rick was devastated, he had no motivation to continue on the rest of his journey.

The frog looks at him dejectedly and replies, ""NO!"" The man looks down and suddenly his penis is 5 inches shorter. ""Wow,"" he screams out loud, ""This is great!!"" But he is still too long at 20 inches, so he asks the frog again."" ""Frog, will you marry me?"" the guy shouts. The frog rolls its eyes back in its head and screams back, ""NO!""

It was a very modest store, consisting of only a couple display cabinets, a meat grinder, and a few shelves in the refrigerator. This man quickly became known all over town as the best butcher around. He eventually was getting so much business that he had to expand his store. Delighted, the butcher purchased a larger location with more display cabinets, larger kitchen space, and a much more spacious refrigerator with room to have many shelves. His business only kept growing from here. People were coming from all over the state and the country to visit him and try some of his delicious meat. Soon, he was able to purchase exotic meat from all over the world. People would come in and eat meat from an animal that they had never heard of. The butcher shop grew ever more popular. The butcher was of course very proud of all he had accomplished. He could see all of his hard work paying off. He was especially proud of these unique meats that he was able to purchase. To ensure that these meats were as fresh as possible, he would put them high up on the shelves in his refrigerator. One day, he received a letter in the mail. It was an invitation to the largest butcher's contest in the world. The butcher was very excited, but was worried when he saw the price to enter the contest: all contestants would have to prepare their very best and most exotic meat, but if you lost, you must give up all the meat in your shop. Conflicted, the butcher began walking around his shop. He looked at the display cabinets that he had worked for years to earn, he looked at his kitchen with all sorts of meat processing equipment, and finally, he went into his refrigeration room. He looked around at all he had worked so hard to earn. There were thousands of dollars of meat in the room. He looked up to the shelves containing the meat that he would use in the competition. After much personal conflict, he walked to the shelves underneath. He looked down at the invitation. He would have to give up everything he had worked for if he lost. But the butcher had faith in his abilities. People had always told him that his meat was the best they had ever had. He looked up at these exotic meats. He had made up his mind. He reached out his arm to grab a slab of meat he had been saving for something special. With arm stretched out, he suddenly paused. He glanced up at the meat, feeling like it was a million miles away. Suddenly, he dropped his arm and stormed out of the refrigerator, shouting, ""I can't do it! The steaks are too high!""",jokes,502

I had to flesh out some details, but the gist of it is more or less what I remember. Of course, I have heard similar jokes, but this is my brain's spontaneous version.A guy got a job with a Chilean start up, and worked nonstop for a year, sacrificing weekends, holidays and time with loved ones, to ensure the business got off the ground. When things finally seemed to be going well, he told his boss he needed 14 days off, for a special trip he had been thinking about. This was a visit to his family's ancestral home deep in the Andes, which nobody in the family had visited for a couple of generations, as it was so remote, only accessible by dirt bike, pack mule, or hiking. It would be 7 days in, and 7 days out, by dirt bike.The boss said ""fine, but take a satellite phone, in case I need to call you"".So, he is 6 days into the trip, just 1 day short of the family village, and immensely enjoying the scenery, chatting with the locals, and sleeping under the stars, when the boss calls and says ""look, we're having a crisis, and I need you back soon as possible. How long will it take?""He says ""I don't know boss, it depends on weather, trail conditions and other factors"". The boss says ""well, do your best"". So he gets back on his bike, and even though it took him 6 days to get as far as he did, it only takes him 3 days to get back.Twenty years go by, and the guy is now a wealthy executive and the company is now huge, but even though he has travelled all around the world on business, he usually only takes a few days of holidays tacked onto a business trip, or if he plans more time off, it is usually interrupted by company needs. He decides he will try again to visit the family's ancestral village, while he is still young and healthy enough to make it. Things have not changed there, and it is still 7 days in, and 7 days out by dirt bike.So again, he is 6 days into the trip, just 1 day short of the family village, and immensely enjoying the scenery, chatting with the locals and sleeping under the stars, when the boss calls him on the satellite phone, and says ""look, we're having a crisis, and I need you back soon as possible. How long will it take?""He says ""I don't know, boss, it depends on weather, trail conditions and other factors"". The boss says ""well, do your best"".

On the first day of trials, the lab assistant realized they had forgotten to pick up the sugar pills that were needed for the placebo. The lead researcher was furious! Most stores in the area were closed, as it was a holiday, and the lab was in a rather remote location. Find me a suitable placebo in 20 minutes or youre FIRED! The lab assistant immediately started searching online. Turns out, the only store that was open and nearby was a novelty shop, that sold all sorts of prank gadgets - hand buzzers, finger traps, that sort of thing. It was a long shot, but the assistant was running out of time, and decided to try it. Sure enough, the store sold fake mints, which looked just like Altoids, but were infused with all sorts of disgusting and repulsive flavors - vomit, garbage juice, wet dog - real nasty stuff. The lab assistant thought, Well, no one is really supposed to taste the pills anyway, we can simply tell the participants that the drug is extremely bitter, so they should swallow quickly with water to avoid tasting it. The assistant bought up the entire stores supply. The plan worked like a charm; none of the participants had any clue which pill was the drug and which was the placebo. But shockingly, the placebo consistently produced a more calming effect than the drug they were actually testing! The lead researcher was confounded, as every subsequent test with these novelty mints yielded the same result. Turns out, the real calm is always in the joke mints.",jokes,292

That was Saturday night, and the next day I had to teach for Buddhist Sunday Dhamma School. Class starts at 10am, and to my horror, I woke up around 10:30am. By the time I drove (completely sober by then) to the temple, it was 10:40am and parents with their kids were waiting outside (Im the one in charge of opening the door as well).As class started, I decided this would be a good opportunity to teach the students a lesson on why drinking alcohol excessively would be a bad idea. So I first recited, *Suramerayamajja pamadatthana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami* (I undertake the precept to abstain from over intoxication and abuse of drugs or alcohol).

So he sent messengers throughout all the lands on the globe encouraging the nations to send their best warriors to come to his palace and compete for this prestigious title. After weeks of intense competition, the candidate pool was reduced to the last three competitors.  Each had earned the honor of demonstrating their martial prowess in front of the emperor himself, and he alone would make the final selection. The first of the three warriors to step up to the throne was a Shaolin monk. After silently bowing to the emperor, the monk proceeded to take out a small matchbox and opened it. A single fly buzzed out. In the blink of an eye, the Shaolin monk unsheathed his sword and made a single swipe at the fly. It fell to the floor in two pieces. The emperor was impressed. The second warrior who approached the throne was a samurai decked in his silk armor. Without wasting any time, he also produced a matchbox of his own, and after opening it, another fly buzzed out. Between the space of a pair of heartbeats, his sword flashed twice. The fly fell to the floor in FOUR pieces. The emperor was VERY impressed.The last warrior to step into the room... was a little underwhelming. He wore no armor, just plain white robes that were a little dusty from the road. He had thick glasses on and wore a yamaka on his head. ""Shalom, your majesty! It is an honor to be here today,"" he said, and proceeded to pull out his own matchbox. As the fly buzzed out, any doubt that the emperor had in this Jewish warrior vanished as his sword blurred in the air to the point it was almost invisible. In the span of 5 seconds, his sword must have swung over 100 times at the fly! In a smooth motion, the warrior sheathed his sword and nodded in satisfaction. The fly continued buzzing around him. After a moment of confused silence, the emperor asked awkwardly, ""...Excuse me, but, uh... why isn't the fly dead?""The warrior tilted his head slightly, and replied, ""Circumcision was never meant to kill, your majesty.""",jokes,373

Soon, he was able to purchase exotic meat from all over the world. People would come in and eat meat from an animal that they had never heard of. The butcher shop grew ever more popular. The butcher was of course very proud of all he had accomplished. He could see all of his hard work paying off. He was especially proud of these unique meats that he was able to purchase. To ensure that these meats were as fresh as possible, he would put them high up on the shelves in his refrigerator. One day, he received a letter in the mail. It was an invitation to the largest butcher's contest in the world. The butcher was very excited, but was worried when he saw the price to enter the contest: all contestants would have to prepare their very best and most exotic meat, but if you lost, you must give up all the meat in your shop. Conflicted, the butcher began walking around his shop. He looked at the display cabinets that he had worked for years to earn, he looked at his kitchen with all sorts of meat processing equipment, and finally, he went into his refrigeration room. He looked around at all he had worked so hard to earn. There were thousands of dollars of meat in the room. He looked up to the shelves containing the meat that he would use in the competition. After much personal conflict, he walked to the shelves underneath. He looked down at the invitation. He would have to give up everything he had worked for if he lost. But the butcher had faith in his abilities. People had always told him that his meat was the best they had ever had. He looked up at these exotic meats. He had made up his mind. He reached out his arm to grab a slab of meat he had been saving for something special. With arm stretched out, he suddenly paused. He glanced up at the meat, feeling like it was a million miles away. Suddenly, he dropped his arm and stormed out of the refrigerator, shouting, ""I can't do it! The steaks are too high!""",jokes,502

4246,"The Festival. You know those guys in the religious order who have that soup-bowl haircut with a bald spot on top?Well, as it turns out, they are avid gardeners in their spare time. Even more so, they love growing flowers. They grow all kinds of flowers. Roses, Orchids, Daisies, you name it, they grow them.Well, one year, a monastery is strapped for cash. They decide to have a village-wide festival and sell their flowers to the public for the cash they need.The first festival didn't go so well, but resolved to try again next the year.Luckily, the next year, a well known movie star (known for playing a movie character that has sharp, retractable metal claws) happened to be in the village.With such a celebrity hosting the festival, things should go really well. So they ask the celebrity if he would host their festival and make himself seen amongst the flowers and talk to the public about flower related things.The actor is in a good mood and agrees.The festival was a raging success! The monastery was now flush with cash. It was so successful that the organizers of the festival asked the celebrity if he would come back and do it again next year.The actor agreed.Not only that, but the actor came back five years in a row!But then, one year, due to scheduling conflicts, the actor couldn't make it to the festival, so they tried to get some other people to host the event.. As a result, the public was severely disappointed and didn't buy very many flowers and the festival was a complete and total dud. The same thing happened the next year as well; the actor couldn't make it to the festival and it was a total failure. No matter who they got to host the festival, it wasn't successful.The organizers were losing tons of money when the actor didn't show up.And they had to face reality and accept that...Only Hugh can present Florist Friars.",jokes,328

While challenged, one of them started:There was a very tired man that walked along a corridor, trying to find an empty compartment to rest his feet. Finally, he found one, already occupied by a lonely man that was playing his ukulele. Knowing that it was his best chance to rest, as he could always use his headphones, he asked the man if he could remove the Duffel bag that was resting in the middle of the otherwise empty seat.Suddenly the man, instead of giving a straight answer, started to sing, while playing his ukulele:I will not remove the bag,I will never remove the bag,I will not remove the bag, Dont make your problem mine.Starting to became angrier, the man asked repeatedly for the man to please remove his bag, but the musician always rendered the same version of his improvised song. Finally, losing his patience, the man picked the Duffel bag, opened the window and tossed it outside. While sitting to rest in the now empty seat, he finally heard the musician starting to play a new song:I would not touch the bag,I would never touch the bag,I could not remove the bag,Because the bag wasn't mine.The second man, while being amused by the joke he heard, answered:My joke also involves a kerfuffle in a train and certainly surpasses yours.I seriously doubt it, but Im ready to hear you.The second man started:There was a man resting in peace, because he found a smoking compartment in an otherwise almost full train. At the moment that he was taking a cigar to smoke, an old lady arrived with a small lapdog, resting in her arms. When she saw that the man was holding a cigar, she asked him to please remain from smoking, to avoid disrupting her dogs sleep.Both started to argue, with the man remembering that it was a smoking section, while the lady became irate for a stranger that was trying to harm her precious dog. The kerfuffle startled the sleeping dog, which started to bark furiously, to protect its owner. Finally, fuming mad with the situation, the man tried to compromise, by opening the window.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!

They set out their separate ways to find a fruit as fast as they can. The first one finds an apple tree and so quickly gathers 10 of them. The second one finds some cherries and plucks a bunch of them.They rush to the chieftain and present the fruits. The chieftain smiles and says,  Now you must shove them up your ass one by one, and if you make any noise or facial expression I will slit your throat right here.The first explorer,resigned to his fate, puts on a brave face and starts shoving the apples. He gets to four and then he cant take it anymore. As soon as he yells in despair, the chieftain takes his knife and slits his throat leaving him to bleed out on the ground.The first explorer dies and reaches the gates of heaven, and while he is walking in he sees the second explorer running to catch up with him.

He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""Curious, Attila did as he asked.Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,""Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.""",jokes,260

We had twenty eggs waiting to hatch, but when they did we only got ten chicks. The moral of this story is not to count your chickens before theyre hatched . Very good, said the teacher again, very pleased with the response so far.Next it was Barneys turn to tell his story: My dad told me this story about my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen was a flight engineer in the war and her plane got hit. She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. Go on, said the teacher, intrigued.Aunt Karen drank the whiskey on the way down to prepare herself. Then she landed right in the middle of a hundred enemy soldiers. She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she ran out of bullets. Then she killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke. And then she killed the last ten with her bare hands. Good heavens, said the horrified teacher, What did your father say was the moral of that frightening Story?The child said: Stay away from Aunt Karen when shes been drinking.",jokes,315

5414,"This joke got me fired when I worked as a cook. Credit goes to Jackie The Joke Man Martling. A husband goes to his wife and says Youre either going hunting with me, sucking my cock or Im fucking you in the ass. Im gonna go get the dogs ready and Ill be back for your answer. After a bit of time, he returns to his wife who defiantly says to him Im not going hunting and theres no way youre fucking me in the ass!Alright then, guess youre sucking my cock.So she starts to suck him off and quickly spits it out and looks up at him. Your dick tastes like shit!Yeah well, the dogs didnt want to go hunting either.Authors Notes: WOW! Never thought this would get this much feedback. A few clarifications for anyone asking: 1. I was in the back end of the kitchen with a fellow cook during a quieter lunch hour when this happened. The place I was working at had been opened less than a month. We had been swapping jokes for a bit before I let this one loose and instead of it being muffled by the sounds of the deep fryer, grill, etc., it was projected out into the main seating area through the ticket window like a speaker. 2. A customer was the one who ultimately complained to the manager and I was gracefully fired the following day when I walked in to start my shift. I had come from working at a bar previously, so the fact that more sensitive people/families were the ones showing up completely slipped my mind as I was in the back cracking joke with the other chef (a  10+ year veteran of the industry.)The owner was pretty cool with everything all things considered, but explained that they just couldnt take the risk of something else happening. I even got to say goodbye to everyone before I left, including the head chef who originally hired me, and everyone was really supportive and understanding. 3. I got a new job shortly after in a warehouse and have been much better off since. I make more money, work less hours, have actual benefits and my bosses are WAY less uptight due to the nature of the job. It was the strangest blessing in disguise Ive ever received as I dont know how much longer I wouldnt lasted in the food industry either way. So in the end, everything worked out.",jokes,414

The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own.
