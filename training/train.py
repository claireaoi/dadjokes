#    "text": "I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clichÃ©d and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say \"Gene Roddenberry's Earth...\" otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So, kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.",

print("#####PRELIMINARIES######")
#1---LOAD DATASET
from datasets import load_dataset

jokedata = load_dataset("imdb") #OLD ONE

# filePATH="/Users/clgl/Github/dadjokes/data_processing/output_jokes_joint.csv"
# dataset = load_dataset("csv", data_files=[filePATH], split="train")
# dataset = dataset.rename_column('joke', 'text')
# #dataset = dataset.rename_column('Unnamed: 0', 'idx')
# dataset = dataset.remove_columns("joke_length_in_words")
# dataset = dataset.remove_columns("Unnamed: 0")
# print(dataset.features)
# #NOTE: label should be  'label': ClassLabel(num_classes=2, names=['not_equivalent', 'equivalent'], names_file=None, id=None),
# #SPLIT DATA
# jokedata=dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1, shuffle=True)
# print(jokedata["train"].features)

#1---LOAD TOKENIZER
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
#Create a preprocessing function to tokenize text and truncate sequences to be no longer than DistilBERTâ€™s maximum input length (512 tokens)

def preprocess_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], truncation=True)

#2---PREPROCESS CHECK LENGTH
tokenized_jokes = jokedata.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)



#Use DataCollatorWithPadding to create a batch of examples.
# It will also dynamically pad your text to the length of the longest element in its batch, so they are a uniform length. 
# While it is possible to pad your text in the tokenizer function by setting padding=True, dynamic padding is more efficient.

#3---DYNAMICALLY PAD TEXT

from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding

data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer)

#5---CREATE MODEL
#Load DistilBERT with AutoModelForSequenceClassification along with the number of expected labels:

# Define your training hyperparameters in TrainingArguments.
#Trainer does not automatically evaluate model performance during training. Youâ€™ll need to pass Trainer a function to compute and report metrics. The ðŸ¤— Evaluate library provides a simple accuracy function you can load with the evaluate.load (see this quicktour for more information) function:

# Pass the training arguments to Trainer along with the model, dataset, tokenizer, and data collator.
